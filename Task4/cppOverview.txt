C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency and versatility.
Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979,
C++ is an extension of the C programming language with added features such as classes and objects,
which support object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
C++ is widely used in software development for creating high-performance applications,
system software, game development, and more.
It offers a rich standard library that provides functionality for various tasks,
making it a preferred choice for complex projects.
C++'s ability to directly manipulate memory and its support for both procedural and OOP paradigms
make it a robust language for diverse programming needs.
